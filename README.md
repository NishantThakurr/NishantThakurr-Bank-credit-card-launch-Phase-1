Description:Atliqo is a small bank. In order to increase its market size and its revenue, It plans to launch its own credit card.This is the phase one of the project where we try to fetch a particular customer segment whom we can target.

## Problem Statement

Atliqo is a small bank. In order to increase its market size and its revenue, It plans to launch its own credit card.
But the credit card competion is cut throught at this particular moment. So in order to compete with other credit card giants it want to target a particular group of customers who are most probable to buy its credit card.
## Roadmap

### Step 1: Figuring out required data
Deciding what kind of data is required for this particular projects. So to analyse customer data, we need to consider different data points such as 
•Age of various customers
•Income
•Spending patterns
•Competion analysis
•Payment type.
So we basically require a payments transactional data

### Step 2: Getting the data
The data was bought from a third party source called data-lelo

### Step 3: Data Validation
Here, we went through the data in order to confirm that we got the type of data that we needed and all column in their correct data type.

### Step 4: Data Cleaning
We basically faced two problems in this part and came up with their solutions also.
##### Handling null values: Used Mean/Median/Mode imputation techniques to solve it
##### Handling Outliers: Used IQR, zscore to find outliers and then used various imputation techniques to solve it.

### Step 5: Data Visualisation and EDA
Performed Univariate and Bivariate Exploratory Data Analysis
to come up with various data visualisations and useful insights.

### Step 6 Finalise the target group
According to the various insight we found, Finalised a target group for the credit card launch

## Outcomes

So according to the data, we decided to target customers with age group 18-25. The reasons were:
•Their low usage of credit cards and heavy reliance on alternative payment methods, suggested that potential opportunity for the credit card company to incentivize increased card usage through targeted rewards or promotional offers.
•They have a moderate Credit score but very low credit limit.
Customers with moderate credit scores but very low credit limits are potential customers for a newly launched credit card company due to their need for credit-building tools and lower risk compared to those with high credit limits.
•They have low annual income but still have a good transaction amount as there interests lie mostly in fashion and tech.
